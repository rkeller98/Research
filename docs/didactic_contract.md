# Didactic contract

Read [WRITING_GUIDE.md](../WRITING_GUIDE.md) first for the repository-wide
notation, style and build contract. This document specifies its didactic intent.

The papers are learning papers, not compressed derivation notes. A reader
should understand why a result must be true, not only reproduce the algebra.

## Required habits

For every important mathematical operation, explain:

1. the problem being solved;
2. why this tool is appropriate;
3. what is difficult without it;
4. what information it exposes;
5. what information it hides;
6. which alternative route reaches the same result.

Central conclusions should use complementary viewpoints where they add
understanding. Eigenvectors begin with the question of invariant directions;
determinants are connected to area or volume scaling and dimensional collapse;
Lagrange multipliers begin with touching level sets and parallel normals; KKT
conditions extend this geometry to several active boundaries; generalized
eigenproblems are developed by whitening a resource ellipsoid into a sphere.

Coordinate transformations must be discoverable from the physics or algebra.
Show why each coordinate is selected, why its complement is independent or
orthogonal, and what becomes visible or invisible after the transformation.

## Checks against memorization

- Separate structural facts from parameter-dependent facts.
- Ask counterfactual questions and show nearby cases where a familiar shape
  classification fails.
- Use small normalized numerical thought experiments before returning to
  machine parameters.
- Treat plots as derivations when possible: show translation, rotation,
  scaling, rank loss, or active-boundary contact rather than only final shapes.
- Explain which assumptions support each conclusion and what changes when
  they are relaxed.

## Section synthesis

Important developments should end with a compact synthesis where it helps:

- Algebra: what equation was obtained?
- Geometry: what shape or transformation does it represent?
- Physics: which machine phenomenon creates it?
- Engineering: why does it matter?
- Alternative view: which other route reaches the same result?
- Assumptions: when does the conclusion fail?

These labels are a thinking checklist, not a mandatory box after every
equation. Understanding takes priority over page count.
